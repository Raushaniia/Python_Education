# In Python, the LEGB rule is used to decide the order in which the namespaces are to be searched for scope resolution.
# The scopes are listed below in terms of hierarchy(highest to lowest/narrowest to broadest):
#
# Local(L): Defined inside function/class
# Enclosed(E): Defined inside enclosing functions(Nested function concept)
# Global(G): Defined at the uppermost level
# Built-in(B): Reserved names in Python builtin modules
